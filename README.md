# Castle Rules
## Objective:
The goal is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards.

## Setup:
### Deck: 
Use a standard 52-card deck, with jokers removed.
### Deal: 
Each player is dealt 9 cards.
#### Initial Layout:
a) Without looking, players randomly select 3 cards from their hand and place them face-down in front of them.

b) Players then look at their remaining 6 cards and choose 3 to place face-up on top of the face-down cards. These will be used after the main deck is exhausted.

## Gameplay:
### Order of Play: 
The game proceeds in ascending order, from 3 to Ace.
### Direction: 
Play starts in a clockwise direction.
### Starting Hand: 
At the beginning of a round, each player should have 3 cards in their hand.
### Starting the Round: 
The player with the lowest card goes first. In case of a tie for the lowest card, the first to place their card goes first.
### Playing Cards: 
Players take turns placing a card of the same value or higher on the stack. Players may play multiple cards of the same number in one turn. The turn continues until a player cannot play a card. At this point, the player either clears the stack or picks up the cards.

### Power Cards:

#### 10: 
Can be played on any card during a turn to clear the stack, and the next player starts afresh.
#### 2: 
Can be played on any card during a turn, allowing the same player to play again with any card they want.
#### 7: 
Must be played in order and requires the next player to play a 7 or lower, or use a power card (2 or 10). If unable, that player picks up the stack.
#### Jack: 
Reverses the order of play. Playing two Jacks counteracts the reversal.

### Player Choices with Deck Present:

#### Starting a Turn with Empty Stack: 
If starting a turn and the stack is empty, a player can choose to either play a card from their hand or draw a card from the deck and play it.

#### Unable to Beat Top Card: 
If a player can't beat the top card in the stack, they have the option to either pick up the stack or take a chance and draw a card from the deck to play. This option is only available if the player has 3 cards in hand, no more. If a player has more than 3 cards, they must pick up the stack without drawing.

#### Completing a Set of Four:
If a card is on the stack and the next player can complete a set of four of the same number, they clear the stack and get to play again.

If a player places all four cards of the same number down at once, it clears the stack, but they do not get to play again.
Players can also clear the stack by completing a set of four out of turn, but they do not get to play again in this case.

## End Game:
Once the Main Deck is Exhausted: After the main deck is out of cards and a player has played the 3 cards in their hand, they proceed to play the 3 face-up cards in front of them.
Playing Face-Up Cards: Players choose from the 3 face-up cards to play until those are exhausted.
Playing Face-Down Cards: After the face-up cards are used, players choose from the face-down cards until those are out.
Unable to Beat the Stack: If a player cannot beat whatever is in the stack with their chosen card, they have to pick up the stack and place the card they tried to play back in its original position.
Winning: The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner.
